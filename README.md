# ESAT-Backend
## Uncover hidden threats and strengthen your security culture with our covert testing tool.

This code repository contains the source code for the Employee security auditing tool backend .
The EMPLOYEE SECURITY AWARENESS TESTING TOOL is a security testing tool aimed at testing the security awareness of employees in an organization. The tool is designed to run on a local network and tests the security of the employee's devices connected to the network, without their knowledge.
Frontend part of the tool is built on streamlit and can be accessed in the Esat-frontend repository.

### Usage:

The tool can be used by organizations to identify security loopholes in their employees' devices and test their security awareness by simulating various attacks. The tool generates reports that help organizations identify areas where they need to improve their security policies and awareness training.

### Case Scenarios:

    Testing Employees' Security Awareness: Organizations can use the tool to simulate various attacks on employees' devices and check how they respond to them. For example, the tool can be used to send a phishing email to an employee and check if they fall for it. The tool can also be used to test if employees are using weak passwords or if they have enabled two-factor authentication.

    Identifying Security Loopholes: The tool can also be used to identify security loopholes in the organization's network and employees' devices. For example, the tool can scan the network for open ports and identify devices that have open ports that could be used to launch an attack.

    Security Awareness Training: The tool can also be used as a training tool to educate employees on security best practices. The tool can generate reports that highlight areas where employees need to improve their security awareness and provide recommendations on how to improve their security practices.

### Features:

    Listing Devices Connected to the WLAN Network: The tool lists all devices connected to the local network along with their IP and MAC addresses.

    Port Scanning on Selected Devices: The tool can perform a port scan on selected devices to identify open ports and services running on those devices.

    Capturing Logs and Network Traffic of a Particular Device: The tool can capture network traffic and logs of a particular device for analysis.

    Implementing Intended Phishing Attacks on Selected Devices: The tool can simulate phishing attacks on selected devices to test the employee's response to such attacks.

### Generating Reports: The tool generates reports that summarize the findings and highlight areas where employees need to improve their security awareness.

### FastAPI Integration: The tool can be integrated with FastAPI to provide an API that allows users to trigger individual modules of the tool remotely.


Overall, the EMPLOYEE SECURITY AWARENESS TESTING TOOL is a powerful security testing tool that can help organizations identify security loopholes and improve their security awareness training. It can be used to test employees' security awareness, identify security loopholes in the network, and educate employees on security best practices.
